Nachdem die Philosophen wie Fichte, Schelling, Hegel in Deutschland, wenn nicht vergessen, doch in Miscredit gekommen sind, steht Kant da wie ein gewaltiges Alpengebirge, in dessen Thäler einzuwandern und dessen Gipfel zu besteigen die Pflicht eines jeden strebsamen deutschen Studenten ist. Andererseits ist es die “Darwinistische Theorie”, welche bei uns mehr und mehr die Geister für sich gewinnt. Ist es da nicht herrlich und wundervoll, dass zwischen Kant’s Philosophie und dem Darwinismus sich eine Brücke befindet, die wir nicht erst künstlich haben anzulegen brauchen, sondern die Kant selbst gebaut hat! Wenn die alten Kirchenväter in Heraklit, Socrates, Platon “Christen vor Christus” sahen; wenn Luther und die Reformatoren nach “Reformatoren vor der Reformation” suchten und sie in mittelalterlichen Schriftstellern fanden; wenn sie diese Vorgänger als Zeugen für die Wahrheit ihrer Lehren benutzten—so können wir nun auch in Kant einen “Darwinisten vor Darwin” und einen “Zeuger für die Wahrheit der Lehre” sehen und ihn als solchen wirkungsvoll benutzen. Ich hoffe, dass Kant, dessen Ansehen in Deutschland bei allen Parteien eine überaus grosses ist, auch die zum Darwinismus bekehren wird, die noch nicht bekehrt sind, oder doch wenigstens ihren Widerstand schwächen und unschädlich machen wird.'}\n",

Beim raschen durchblättern Ihres glänzenden Werkes, das mich als Botaniker ganz besonders interessiren muß, fand ich das hübsche Capitel über Drosera rotundifolia, eine am Katzensee in Tausenden von Exemplaren vorkommenden Pflanze.

Meine Schüler waren nicht weniger erstaunt u erfreut als ich u das veranlaßte mich, einige Dutzend der lebenden Pflanze mit nach Hause zu nehmen, um die Beobachtungen zu wiederholen.

The latter is a little bush only 3\\xa0ft.\\xa0high (Loudon), and when I read your account, it seemed to me a physical impossibility that a sporting branch of C.\\xa0alpinus could grow to any size and be supported on the extremely delicate branches of C.\\xa0purpureus. If I understand rightly your letter, you consider the tuft of small shoots on one side of the sporting C.\\xa0alpinus from Weirleigh as C.\\xa0purpureus; but these shoots are certainly those of C.\\xa0adami. I earnestly beg you to look at the specimens enclosed. The branch of the true C.\\xa0purpureus is the largest which I could find. If C.\\xa0adami was sold to your brother as C.\\xa0purpureus, everything is explained; for then the gardener has grafted C.\\xa0adami on C.\\xa0alpinus, and the former has sported in the usual manner; but has not sported into C.\\xa0purpureus, only into C.\\xa0alpinus. C.\\xa0adami does sport less frequently into C.\\xa0purpureus than into C.\\xa0alpinus. Are the purple flowers borne on moderately long racemes? If so, the plant is certainly C.\\xa0adami, for the true C.\\xa0purpureus bears flowers close to the branches. I am very sorry to be so troublesome, but I am very anxious to hear again from you.'}\n",

I have now read it with much interest, & am astonished that such a work could have been prepared at Sydney. I have been particularly interested by your account of the movements of Pterostylis & Caladenia. Do you think it possible that the calli on the labellum are gnawed or sucked by insects? A careful examination of the flowers from which the pollinia have been removed by insects, would be well worth making. I daresay you have seen a good paper on the former genus in a late vol of the N.\\xa0Zealand Institute. I have been even more interested about the closed flowers of Thelymitra, as the case is closely analogous to the equally inaccessible one of the Bee Ophrys in Europe. I suppose you have few coadjutors, but it would be well to ascertain whether the flowers are closed during years when the seasons are very different, & in all parts of the plant’s range. I will venture to make one other suggestion; viz with sterile species like Dendrobium hillii to try the effects of pollen taken from a distinct seedling plant, in accordance with the observations of Fritz Müller. I have found it almost necessary to observe insects at work to understand the meaning of the parts in orchids & on this head I see that you are a disbeliever. From not having been able to act in this manner I blundered about Cypripedium; but I do not think I have erred about the nectary of Angræcum, & Wallace has given the case of a sphinx with proboscis of sufficient length.'}\n",

I have been thinking that perhaps even I might be able, by accurately tabulating and comparing such cases as I know, to do something towards ascertaining the truth or error of some of Mr.\\xa0Galton’s conclusions, at least as far as my own conviction is concerned. The point which naturally has the greatest interest for me, about which I am most anxious to find out something certain, is, how far heredity is limited by sex in the human race, especially whether mental qualities are at all limited by it. I am well aware that your own, I think, provisional view is, that even mental qualities are thus limited; I myself know so comparatively many striking instances to the contrary, among my friends and my own family, that it seems highly improbable to me. At any rate, every woman ought to try to ascertain as much of the truth in respect to it as she can; for apart from the interest of the question in itself, it is most important for the future of women.'}\n",

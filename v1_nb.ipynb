      "now for a letter in answer to your two ones on classification—on which i have been often thinking it has long appeared to me that the root of the difficulty in settling such questions as yours—whether number of species c c should enter as an element in settling the value or existence of a group—lies in our ignorance of what we are searching after in our natural classifications— linnæus confesses profound ignorance— most authors say it is an endeavour to discover the laws according to which the creator has willed to produce organized beings— but what empty highsounding sentences these are— it does not mean order in time of creation nor propinquity to any one type as man— in fact it means just nothing— according to my opinion which i give every one leave to hoot at like i should have six years since hooted at them for holding like views classification consists in grouping beings according to their actual relationship ie their consanguinity or descent from common stocks— in this view all relations of analogy c c  consist of those resemblances between two forms which they do not owe to having inherited it from a common stock— to me of course the difficulty of ascertaining true relationship ie a natural classification remains just the same though i know what i am looking for— this being the case viz ignorance of a distinct object i think we ought to look at classification as a simple logical process ie a means of conveying much information through single words— now the laws of classification tryed by this rule—it is clear that neither number of species—nor grade of organization ought to come in as an element— for instance the word marsupiata implies a great number of facts common to many animals and if by introducing another group of animals the definition of marsupiata is forced to include any one fact not applicable to the former animals then i maintain the second group ought not to have been added to the first but if they have much in common a third more general term ought to be invented to include them— viewing classification as a logical process the only cheque to the splitting of groups appears to be convenience  if you had objected to making the monotremes  the styloptera orders on account of the inconvenience of increasing the number of orders i think it might have been valid i repeat that until you can define your object in classifying you have no right to introduce number of species or arbitary grades of organization but are bound to follow simple amount of differences of organization— this i think you will find is the rule amongst botanists  they have many families very small in number— this is clearly the rule on the view of classification being a genealogical process exhibiting literal or actual relationship\n",

      "your letter has led me to think over vivisection i wish some new word like anæssection could be invented for some hours  i will jot down my conclusions which will appear very unsatisfactory to you— i have long thought physiology one of the grandest of sciences sure sooner or more probably later greatly to benefit mankind but judging from all other sciences the benefits will accrue only indirectly in the search for abstract truth it is certain that physiology can progress only by experiments on living animals— therefore the proposal to limit research to points of which we can now see the bearings in regard to health c i look at as puerile i thought at first it wd be good to limit vivisection to public laboratories but i have heard only of those in london  cambridge  i think oxford but probably there may be a few others therefore only men living in a few great towns could carry on investigation  this i shd consider a great evil if private men were permitted to work in their own houses  required a license i do not see who is to determine whether any particular man shd receive one it is young unknown men who are the most likely to do good work— i wd gladly punish severely anyone who operated on an animal not rendered insensible if the experiment made this possible but here again i do not see that a magistrate or jury cd possibly determine such a point therefore i conclude if as is likely some experiments have been tried too often or anæsthetics have not been used when they could been the cure must be in the improvement of humanitarian feelings—\n",
